    <h1>About How to Change A Life</h1>

    <h2>Who we are</h1>

    <p><strong>How to Change A Life</strong> is a collection of resources and individuals that empowers people to make a change in their lives and the lives of others. It does not pretend to have all the answers but it does provide a number of frameworks and ideas to help you on your way to making a change. This is a dymanic collection so please add any suggestions or ideas that work for you in the form at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h2>Why we exist</h1>

    <p>OK, so this isn't an existential crisis asking "Why do we exist", it's just a quick summary of why we were set up. How to Change a Life was set up because our founder wanted to empower others to make a change both to themselves and to the lives of others. She had no training, just a passion for empowering people, so she decided to speak to the people around her and collect all the resources she knew that worked for her, then for her friends and then family. But she hit a wall. She felt disheartened that this wasn't going to affect anyone. Those who want to change, can already look things up for themselves. So she created this website as a way of interacting with people, learning from them, and tracking the changes people made in the world. Because each of those small changes can mean something big. And those big differences can mean something bigger. A whole community of people making a change.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to insert extra blank lines manually using the br tag. The br tag is a special type of tag (called a 'void tag'); you don't need a closing br tag, just un opening one.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>Html has two basic types of list:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;) - displays a numbered list</li>
      <li>Unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;) - displays a list of bullet points</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Both have the same basic structure.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>An opening list tag</li>
    <li>Many list items (&lt;li&gt;)</li>
    <li>A closing list tags</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You don't often see lists in their basic form, but lists are heavily used in websites; dropdown menus are often cleverly styled lists.</p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>Links look like this: <a href="http://www.facebook.com">link to facebook</a>. You specify where you want the link to point by specifying the 'href' inside the &lt;a&gt; tag.</p>

    <p>The href can also point to local files. For example, <a href="./example.html">this</a> is a link to this page you're reading at the moment. Notice that the protocol and host part of the URL has been replaced by a "."</p>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>Images are a bit like links. You specify the location of the image with the 'src' property in the &lt;img&gt; tag. Note that img tags are like br tags: they don't come in pairs. The 'alt' property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.</p>

    <p>Images can be stored on the same host ... </p>
    <img src="./local_image.png" alt="A local image">

    <p>... or on another server entirely.</p>

    <h2>Tables</h2>
    <p>Tables are used for holding data</p>
    <table class='table'>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>College</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tom</td>
        <td>Oriel</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Dave</td>
        <td>Hertford</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
